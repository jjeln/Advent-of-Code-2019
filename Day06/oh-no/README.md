# Python Crimes

A failed attempt to work without external libraries. No graph, no tree, no nodes... Just list and dictionary manipulation.
The worst part? It perfectly works with the input example given in the first part.

Two hours after I started working on this, and as I started to get desperate, I found out about networkx. Well... Thanks, I guess?
Anyway, I still upload this incomplete/half-working solution to show that doing some research before diving into a puzzle might be a good idea.
